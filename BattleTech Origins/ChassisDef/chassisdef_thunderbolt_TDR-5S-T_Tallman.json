She had the 'Mech stripped of everything save the Large Laser, and installed a brace of 4 Medium Lasers in each torso. An additional 8 Heat Sinks were added.\n\nThe Bremond DMM was once the home for criminals and thugs, but Mary Tallman made it her mission to clean up the unit, and she succeeded beyond anyone's hopes. The unit became well-regarded by the time they participated in the campaign for Galtor III.\n\nMary partipated directly during at least two operations on Galtor III. The first was the battle for a Star League Depot on 1-2 September 3025 and the second time on 27th September 3025 on the plains northwest of New Derry. Both battles ended in victory for the Bremond DMM and combined Federated Suns forces and even though she was offered a promotion, she chose to remain in command of the Bremond DMM and remained the 'cream of the crop in the Draconis March Militia."
