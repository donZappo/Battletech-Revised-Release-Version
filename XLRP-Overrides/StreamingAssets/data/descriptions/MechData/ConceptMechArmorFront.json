    "Details" : "Armor equipped on a 'Mech is used to protect its vital internal structure, as well as its weapons, ammo, and other critical systems. Damaged armor does not stop a 'Mech from dropping, but needs to be repaired after battle to keep the 'Mech at an optimal fighting condition. A location's underlying structure can support up to twice its Structure points in Armor. Torso locations are armored in both the front and rear, and each facing has its own Armor value and maximum.",
