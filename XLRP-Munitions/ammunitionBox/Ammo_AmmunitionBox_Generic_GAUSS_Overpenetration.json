Gauss Ammo Bins will not explode as opposed to other types of ammunition.\r\n\r\nGauss Rifle Overpenetration Ammunition utilizes an advanced alloy that is both durable and highly magnetic. Using this ammo the weapon's firing charge can be increased beyond the normal threshold, giving a large boost to projectile velocity and improving its penetrative power. This comes at the cost of vastly increased heat generation and reduced chance to inflict critical hits. Overpenetration Gauss Ammo Bins each contain <color=#6aa84f>8 rounds</color> and may feed multiple weapons.\r\n\r\n<color=#d9d9d9><b>Ammunition type can be changed by clicking the middle of the weapons activation panel during combat if more than one type of ammunition is present.</b>",
