Without it, it is quite possible that we will blow up in the vast reaches of space if we had to put any kind of load on them at all. Since the drive engines supply the ship's power, it is also imperative that we get them 'up to speed' in order to upgrade any other systems on the ship. Repairing the drive engines will increase drive output by <color=#2EFE9A><b>20%</b></color>",
