Sumire and I pulled some strings and managed to find someone selling a junked Leopard. The seller says it â€˜ran when parked,' but from what I know of the lady I wouldn't get my hopes up. It may never fly again, but we can use it for parts to improve the performance of our own Leopard. Hell, if we're real lucky we might even be able to upgrade it over its original operating specs.</color></b>",
