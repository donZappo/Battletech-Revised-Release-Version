Sumire and I pulled some strings and managed to find someone selling a junked <i>Leopard</i>. The seller says it 'ran when parked' but I wouldn't get my hopes up. It may never fly again, but we can use it for parts to improve the performance of our own <i>Leopard</i>. Hell, if we're lucky we might even be able to upgrade it over its original operating specs.",
