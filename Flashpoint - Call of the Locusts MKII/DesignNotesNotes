7-The hand slips quickly away and he escapes into the crowd and you return to your inner struggles.  Later that evening you feel inside your jacket pocket and come up with a note - it reads.
"Commander {COMMANDER.LastName} it looks like you need a hand." 
Turning the note over you notice a set of GPS Coordinates and a time - now long expired.

when things don't load do you know how to look at logs?
they often have the errors in there
BATTLETECH\Mods\.modtek\ModTek.log and BATTLETECH\Mods\.modtek\harmony_summary.log and (if you're using FYLS logger mod which is highly recommended you'll see a  BATTLETECH\Mods\cleaned_output_log.txt) and BATTLETECH\BattleTech_Data\output_log.txt
try loading the mod up with your image - when it crashes - send me those logs
