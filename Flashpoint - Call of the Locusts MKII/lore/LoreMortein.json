    "Details" :"Centuries ago a German immigrant to Australia, on Terra, became fed up with it's interminable parade of blood sucking insects. So, he used crushed chrysanthemum flowers to produce a plant extract and created an insecticidal wonder. The name, in the early 1900's on Terra it was believed to have been devised by a German called Hagemann and his French wife, being a combination of the French word mort (dead) and the German ein (one). Dead one! And the rest is history.",
