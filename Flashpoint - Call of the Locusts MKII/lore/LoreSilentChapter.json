    "Details" :"The Silent Chapter is the 'Strong Arm' of The Band of the Damned. Formed as the personal security force for their operation by Vance Rezak's second in command 'Dicky' Smith. There is nothing, both legal and illicit, that The Band are not involved in. The Silent Chapter enforce control of their slice of the Black Market in the Periphery for themselves and are HIGHLY selective about who works for them.",
