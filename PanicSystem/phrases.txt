Farewell, cruel world.

It's all over.
The fat lady sang.
Why does this happen to me?
I'm going down.
Pow!
Bif!
Bam!
Zonk!
Should'a listened to Ma...
What was that noise?
Mama said there'd be days like this.
Its just one of those days...
I see a bright light...
Mommy? Is that you?
I let you hit me!
Sucker shot!
I didn't want to live anyway.
-<sob>-
Was that as close as I think it was?
Join the corps, see the world they said.
I didn't like violence anyway!
I thought you liked me?
I think this guy's a little crazy.
Hey! Killin' ain't cool.
Gee... thanks.
I've fallen and I can't get up!
I'll be back...
Hey - I've got lawyers.
Frack!
Glory!
NOOOoooo... 
Leeeeroooy...
I can't feel my legs!
They said it would be a cakewalk!
Nothing more to do here.

Craven, Cross-Eyed, Cur!
Curse you Edmon!
