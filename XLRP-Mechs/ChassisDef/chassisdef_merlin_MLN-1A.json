    "Details": "The Merlin first debuted in 3010 and was hailed as a technological marvel of engineering.  Mounting a PPC as its primary armament gives the Merlin the option to stay at a distance from its adversaries.  This is further supplemented with an LRM5 launcher.  If anything manages to get close enough in, the Merlin also mounts a pair of Medium Lasers and a Flamer.  It even has a Machine Gun to help dissuade infantry from getting too close.  The MLN-1A caries ten tons of armor, giving it reasonable protection, and eighteen heatsinks to help with the heat load.",

The Merlin is the first new 'Mech to be developed in over a century, and can you believe it was made in the Periphery?  For the most part, they really thought it through, easy to find repair parts, a reasonably solid design, but seriously, who puts all their ammo in the center torso... that thing is going to go up like a Capellan New Year's fireworks show anytime someone gets past that armor."
