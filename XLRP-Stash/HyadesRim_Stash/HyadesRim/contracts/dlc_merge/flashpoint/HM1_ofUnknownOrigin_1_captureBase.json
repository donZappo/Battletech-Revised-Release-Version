    "shortDescription" : "According to ISF intelligence, Captain Gaku Magorian is being held prisoner in one of a dozen safe houses in this system, and Yamaguchi's data keeps refering to this system as Tarragona although it's dated from centuries ago. Something is odd, and I know enough not to trust fully Kurita intel, so we're going to have to narrow down the list ourselves. Our unidentified syndicate is known to maintain a forward base in this AO. Capture it so that Dr. Murad can scour the OpFor's mainframe for confirmation of Captain Magorian's whereabouts.",
    "longDescription" : "I still can't believe that we don't even know who we're fighting against. It is what it is, I guess.",
