      "Details":"Stoessi made himself a name taking part in Mech races as a teenager. He soon graduated to the UMFC (Ultimate Mech Fight Club) and demonstrated a respectable career in this brain- (and mech) wrecking sport. Unfortunately, this career came to a halt when he accidently hit one of his opponents a little too hard and killed him. Stoessi got disqualified from the league and had to find new ways of making his living. So, here he is these days, putting his piloting skills to work accepting pretty much any gig that will pay the bills. ",
