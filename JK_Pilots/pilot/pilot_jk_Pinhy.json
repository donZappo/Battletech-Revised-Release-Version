      "Details":"Doug’s early ancestors had stolen away from Clan Wolverine in the early 2800’s, just as rumors of crimes against the 'Clan Way' were surfacing. They found their way to Inner Sphere space onboard, of all unlikely means, a Clan Snow Raven warship. His family served the Snow Raven Clan as ‘Mech pilots for a few generations.  But when his father fell in love with, and married, a young relative of the recently deceased Khan Ewan McCorkell, his Wolverine heritage was uncovered, and the two lovers barely escaped with their lives….and her ancestral Shadow Hawk IIC.  Settling in Davion territory, his father earned a living in his Shadow Hawk as a mercenary for hire.\r\n\r\nDoug was born on January 1st, 3001. A new-millennium baby, with royal blood in his veins, he knew he was destined to be special. Growing up around pilots and techs of all sorts, he showed an uncanny ability to understand the concepts and mechanics of a Battlemech. When he was barely able to reach the controls, he started practicing in any mech his father’s friends would let him get his hands on.\r\n\r\nWhen his childhood sparring partner, and girlfriend, Jessica was falsely arrested and imprisoned due to a security scan glitch, Doug applied to the Albion Military Academy and excelled at almost everything…..except following the rules.  As one of the best in his class, he felt he was above discipline. After only two years, he left the academy and struck out on his own, to follow in his father’s Mercenary footsteps.\r\n\r\nAlways proud of his Wolverine and Snow Raven heritage and having heard rumors about the downfall of Clan Wolverine being a set up by Nicholas Kerensky, he vowed to one day hunt down and kill any Kerensky descendants.\r\n\r\nHe also heard that Jessica was out of prison, her name cleared.  She was now going by 'Glitch.'",
