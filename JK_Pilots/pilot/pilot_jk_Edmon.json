        "Details": "After pirates had seemingly slaughtered most of the population of his home town while he was away on a trade mission, Edmon swore revenge. That they had decided to create a slave den and pleasure house on what used to be his grandfathers land only sought and drove his desire to make them suffer for every transgression.\r\n\r\nThe food and commodities of his backwater home, that no house truly cared about, were barely enough to pay for a dilapidated Commando COM-1C that no one wanted.  The travelling market trader was was happy to be off-load this barely functional AC/2 variant in exchange for something useful, like supplies, even if those supplies were lower in theoretical value.  When questioned on why he was trading for a mech, however weak, instead of for the usual package of medicines, textiles and tools, he remained uncharacteristically silent on the matter.\r\n\r\nAfter trading in every favor he was owed, Edmon was able to get the Commando back into a mostly functional condition, as well as acquiring a sizable cache of ammunition.  It was soon after that his dark work would begin. In a campaign lasting months, the new pirate home was ceaselessly harassed with AC/2 fire from random directions and from great distances.  'Mechs and vehicles slowly took damage, and pirates outside playing cards, walking around or even relieving themselves on trees were shot seemingly at random.\r\n\r\nWhen the pirates finally discovered Edmon's hidden ammo stockpile, they were down to three crippled BattleMechs.  Their stakeout didn't last long though, as one of the damaged 'Mechs tripped a booby trap which detonated the stockpile, causing a massive explosion with a wall of AC/2 rounds flying in all directions.  All three pirates and Edmon's mech, lurking nearby with nearly zero ammo remaining, were shredded. Amazingly, a stray AC/2 round triggered the ejection system on Edmon's mech, launching him safely and involuntarily from the increasingly vicious secondary explosions. Some might call that lucky, but with his home lost, his victory allowed him to move on and nothing more.",
