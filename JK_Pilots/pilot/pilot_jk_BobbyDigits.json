      "Details":"Gigs Diggi was born illegitimately into a wealthy branch of the Steiner bloodline. Due to his illegitimate birth, he was raised outside the big city by simple farmers who were the kin of palace servants whom his mother trusted. Upon turning 16, his adoptive parents shared with him the truth of who his birth mother was. This revelation filled him with a sense of confusion about who he was and who he could trust, prompting him to run away with dreams of adventure - something far from a tractor but definitely heavy and metal.\n\nAt first, he set out to be a soldier, but it turns out they weren't just handing out mech piloting jobs like they were infantry ones. Undeterred, he used their training resources to get some simulator time but ultimately hated being a small cog in some giant army's wheel - so he went AWOL with no real plan as to what would happen next. Drifting about, he eventually fell in with a group of pirates who needed a new hand, and concealing his 'somewhat' noble birth, he bluffed his way into their good graces and went on to learn the practical aspects of being a MechWarrior. Every new raid was a chance to level up both skill-wise and financially.\n\nEventually the life of a pirate grew thin as the toll of questionable morals and a feast or famine existence began to mount up. He longed to belong to something better. Torn between worlds, he met Darius at just the right time when he was trying to put together a crew and Darius was willing to give an ex-pirate a chance and so he gave Darius one too. Turns out being a mercenary is all the fun of being a pirate with some added legitimacy that somehow made the difference he was looking for. Still, those old contacts he made trying to offload the spoils from his pirate raiding days might still be useful... so might revealing his noble birth, one day.",
