This early version was equipped with a single PPC and Autocannon/5, as well as two arm mounted Medium Lasers.  Its EW equipment was integrated into the chassis of the 'Mech, making it all but impossible to transfer to another 'Mech.",

Looks like the integrated the Raven's ECM equipment into the chassis along with some additional sensor equipment.  The firepower is a little lacking for its weight, but at least you shouldn't have too many issues with heat."
